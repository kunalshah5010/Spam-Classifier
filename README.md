Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes ðŸ“¨

This repository contains an implementation of a Spam Classifier based on the Naive Bayes Classification theorem, featuring an interactive Streamlit-based frontend for testing and demonstration. The classifier categorizes email messages as either spam or not spam using text-based features and machine learning.

Features

Text Preprocessing:
- Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Bag-of-words (BoW) vectorization for efficient representation.
- Naive Bayes Classifier: Implements Multinomial Naive Bayes for text classification.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision and Recall.
- Interactive Streamlit Interface: Upload or type email text and instantly see predictions in an intuitive UI.
